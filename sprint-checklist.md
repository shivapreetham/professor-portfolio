0. Pre-Work (Before the 6-Hour Sprint)
Have your tools ready:
Node.js, your preferred code editor, Git initialized in your project repo.
A Supabase account with a project set up (for auth and your database schema).
Plan out your data schema:
Sketch out the database tables/fields (e.g., projects, research papers, conferences, achievements, blog posts, about, teaching, awards, collaborations).
Optional: Create rough wireframes of your portfolio and admin panel layouts.
Hour 1: Project Setup & Base Component Creation
Project Initialization (0:00–0:20)



Create Next.js App:
bash
Copy
Edit
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript my-portfolio
Install Tailwind CSS:
Follow the official Tailwind CSS with Next.js guide to set it up.
Install Supabase Client:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
Basic Folder & Routing Structure (0:20–0:40)

Create folders for your components, pages, and admin panel (e.g., /components, /pages/admin).
Set up basic routing:
A public homepage (/pages/index.tsx) that renders your portfolio.
An admin login page (/pages/admin/login.tsx) and dashboard page (/pages/admin/index.tsx).
Setup Supabase Auth (0:40–1:00)

Configure a Supabase client in a separate file (e.g., /lib/supabaseClient.ts).
Create a basic login form component that uses Supabase’s authentication methods (e.g., signIn with email/password).
Add basic error handling and redirection on successful login to the admin dashboard.
Hour 2: Building the Portfolio Components
Component Skeletons (1:00–1:30)

Create separate components for each section:
<AboutProfessor />
<Projects />
<ResearchPapers />
<Conferences />
<Achievements />
<BlogPosts />
<TeachingExperience />
<Awards />
<Collaborations />
Use simple and subtle Tailwind CSS classes for a clean design.
Each component should accept props (or fetch its own data) to render dynamic content.
Integrate Components in the Homepage (1:30–2:00)

In /pages/index.tsx, import and arrange your components in order.
Ensure each component has an “edit” icon (visible only if an admin flag is active) which will eventually link to its edit form in the admin panel.
Use dummy/static data for now.
Hour 3: Admin Panel – Base and Authentication Integration
Admin Dashboard Layout (2:00–2:20)

Create a layout for your admin pages (e.g., /components/AdminLayout.tsx) to handle common UI elements (sidebar, header, etc.).
Secure your /pages/admin/* routes by checking for a valid Supabase session or token.
Admin Login & Protected Routes (2:20–2:40)

Finalize the login form with Supabase auth.
Implement a higher-order component or middleware in Next.js to protect admin routes (if not already done).
Test the login flow and redirection.
Admin Dashboard Overview (2:40–3:00)

On the admin dashboard (/pages/admin/index.tsx), display a preview of each portfolio component.
For each component preview, include an “Edit” icon/button that navigates to the specific edit form (e.g., /pages/admin/edit-projects.tsx).
Hour 4: Admin Forms for Editing Content
Setup Form Components (3:00–3:30)

For each portfolio section, create a corresponding admin form component (e.g., <ProjectsForm />, <AboutForm />, etc.).
Use controlled form inputs with React state for each field.
Pre-fill form data by fetching the current content from Supabase (or using static data if backend isn’t fully set up yet).
Edit Flow Implementation (3:30–4:00)

In each admin form page:
Fetch data for the selected component from Supabase.
Render the form with the current content.
Add a “Preview” button that either toggles a preview mode or opens a modal showing how the content will look.
Add a “Save/Update” button to commit changes back to Supabase.
Wire up API calls (using Supabase client) to update the database on form submission.
UI & UX Polishing for Forms (4:00–4:30)

Ensure forms are styled with Tailwind for consistency.
Add validation (e.g., required fields) and success/error notifications.
Hour 5: Integrating Preview and Edit Options on the Frontend
Admin Preview Mode (4:30–5:00)

Modify your admin dashboard to allow a preview mode:
When in preview mode, display the portfolio as it would appear to the public but with edit icons.
Ensure clicking an edit icon brings up the corresponding form with data pre-populated.
Dynamic Updates (5:00–5:15)

Optionally implement “live preview” functionality:
As the admin types in the form, update a preview component in real time.
This could be done by maintaining state in the parent component and passing it to both the form and preview display.
Supabase Data Sync (5:15–5:30)

Double-check that saving changes from the admin forms updates the Supabase database.
Verify that the public portfolio page fetches and displays the updated data.
Hour 6: Testing, Debugging, and Final Touches
Comprehensive Testing (5:30–5:45)

Walk through the entire flow:
Public site: Ensure components display correctly with dummy data or live data.
Admin login: Verify authentication, route protection, and redirection.
Editing content: Test the edit forms, preview functionality, and data updates.
Check responsiveness and design consistency across devices.
Error Handling & Notifications (5:45–5:55)

Add any missing error states (e.g., failed API calls, validation errors).
Implement user notifications (toast messages or inline alerts) for successful saves, errors, etc.
Final Code Review & Deployment Setup (5:55–6:00)

Commit your code changes.
If possible, deploy to Vercel (or your chosen hosting provider) for a quick live demo:
bash
Copy
Edit
vercel --prod
Ensure environment variables (for Supabase URL and anon/public keys) are set in your deployment settings.
Additional Tips
Time Management:

Keep components lean initially; focus on functionality over perfection.
Use dummy data if the Supabase backend isn’t fully populated yet.
Version Control:

Commit frequently. This helps you track progress and revert if necessary.
Fallback Plan:

If you run out of time, prioritize the public-facing portfolio and a basic admin edit functionality over advanced live preview features.
Post-Sprint Iterations:

Once the MVP is up in 6 hours, plan for subsequent iterations to polish the UI, add error boundaries, and refine the user experience.
